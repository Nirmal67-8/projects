        "    there were buildings for middle and secondary education,the lack of teaching staff, basic facilities,\n",
        "     books, furniture, and financial support meant that they remained unused. For years,\n",
        "    we faced numerous struggles. It was not until around 2007 that we began to see a change in our village's educational landscape.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Challenges Faced\n",
        "    During those early years, the primary challenge was the low enrollment rate.\n",
        "    Students were hesitant to attend school due to the lack of resources\n",
        "    and support. This posed a significant obstacle to our educational aspirations, particularly for girls.\n",
        "    In rural areas, the concept of female education was nearly nonexistent.\n",
        "    Girls were not allowed to leave the village for education.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Middle School Opportunity\n",
        "    However, after considerable effort and advocacy, we managed to secure the establishment of a middle school in our village.\n",
        "    This marked a turning point, especially for female students. The increased enrollment led to a higher ratio of girls attending school.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Secondary Education\n",
        "    As the years passed, our village continued to progress; the middle school eventually expanded to include secondary education.\n",
        "    With two primary schools, two middle schools, and secondary schools, we finally had the educational infrastructure we had longed for,\n",
        "    although the facilities remained basic.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Improved Literacy Rate\n",
        "    The impact of these changes was remarkable. Our village's literacy rate began to rise steadily, surpassing that of neighboring villages.\n",
        "    Students from grade 5 and 8 were achieving impressive results, and our village became known for its dedication to education.\n",
        "\n",

        "    One of the most encouraging developments was the success of our students in various scholarship programs. Many students from\n",
        "    our village secured scholarships to prestigious institutions like Pak-Turk international school and college Karachi,\n",
        "    AQ Khan School & College in Islamabad and IBA public schools, often with full scholarships. Our village became a hub for aspiring medical students,\n",
        "    many of whom are now pursuing MBBS and nursing degrees.\n",
